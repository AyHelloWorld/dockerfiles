# NOTE: Assumes "namespace inbox" has been defined in 10-mail.conf.
namespace inbox {

  # These mailboxes are widely used and could perhaps be created automatically:
  mailbox Drafts {
    special_use = \Drafts
  }
  mailbox Junk {
    special_use = \Junk
  }
  mailbox Trash {
    special_use = \Trash
  }

  # For \Sent mailboxes there are two widely used names. We'll mark both of
  # them as \Sent. User typically deletes one of them if duplicates are created.
  mailbox Sent {
    special_use = \Sent
  }
  mailbox "Sent Messages" {
    special_use = \Sent
  }

  mailbox virtual/All {
    special_use = \All
  }

  mailbox virtual/Flagged {
    special_use = \Flagged
  }
}
